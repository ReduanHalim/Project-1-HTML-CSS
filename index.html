                <h3>Sculptured warriors</h3>
                <p>Purpose of guarding the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang, 
                the Terracotta army is a vast collection off sculptures made of terracotta buried with the emperor<p>

                <h3>Unintentional discovery</h3>
                <p>In the year of 1974, a farmer by the name Yang Zhifa was digging a well when he spotted fragments of pottery.
                    This find further led to the discovery of the Terracotta army </p>
            </div>
            

            <div>
                <h3>The scale of the discovery is huge</h3>
                <p>Since the discovery of the Terracotta Army, more than 2,000 warriors and horses have been excavated from three different burial pits with an estimated 
                    6,000 still buried underground. It is perhaps the enormous scale of the discovery that has added to the mystery and captivated the world, 
                    leading people to start describing the warriors as the 8th wonder of the world</p>
            </div>

            <div id="figure"></div>

            <div>
                <h3 id="more">More than just warriors</h3>
                <p>In recent discoveries we can find sculptures of entertainers such as acrobats and musicians. Birds were also amongst the finds. This shows that 
                    not only was the emperors protection concidered but also activites for his amusement </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Not a single identical figure</h3>
                <p>Despite the vast number of warriors, each warrior has unique facial features and styles. The warriors of different ranks were buried 
                    in battle formation to representa real army and are split into infantrymen, archers, generals, cavalrymen, charioteers, officers,
                     and guards of honour, all different in their expressions, clothing, and hairstyles</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>There were no historical records of them existing</h3>
                <p>The discovery of the Terracotta Warriors was a complete surprise to everyone because there are no historical records of them, or of an underground army.
                     They had sat untouched underground for more than 2,200 years. This only adds to the mystery, as it is now the largest and most important tomb 
                     site in China</p>
