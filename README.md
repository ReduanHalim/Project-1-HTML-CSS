## Features

*  A convenience for users to swap screens and still get the full immersion.

## Landing page

*  The first thing the users notice when they open the website is a background imgage of a huge collection of terracotta sculptures. I decided to not include any text so that the users gets a big first impression of the marvelous discovery.

## Content section

* Because this website is about a historical piece, alot of information is needed. In this section i wrote mostly about different facts about the subject.

*  An image was also added to make this section more appealing to the users.

## Iframe

*  I added a live google map right above the footer. The maps purpose is to make it easier to find the Terracotta Warriors Museum for users that are interested to visit. It's also a more fun way of adding a location.

## Footer

*  Fun icons that are linked to differednt social medias and information website. The links will open on a new tab.

## Gallery

*  The gallery includes multiple images of the discovery. The gallery acts as a gateway to further get the users hooked on the subject. 

*  By seing such wonderful images, the users might want to visit the museum. 

## Score tickets page

* I created a form that is easy to fill in details. By submitting their name and email they get a chance to win tickets to visit the museum. 

*  This will attract more users to the website.

## Testing

*  A couple of errors popped up while testing my code. This is my first ever website that i have coded. And because of that i had some trouble at the beginning to find and correct the errors properly.

*  about 6-7 errors were returned when i testet the index/gallery and scoretickets files. But after sometime i maged to correct all the errors.
